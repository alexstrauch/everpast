## Introduction

### Project description

- Everpast is a Django-based web application that enables users to create digital time capsules by uploading images, videos, and documents, which can be locked until a specified future date. The project aims to bridge the gap between past and future by providing a secure, digital way to preserve memories and messages for future access.

### Purpose

- Memory preservation: Users can securely store personal memories, photos, videos and documents in digital time capsules.

- Future communication: Enable users to send messages, letters or media to their future selves or loved ones, accessible only after a predetermined date.

- Legacy creation: Provide a platform for users to create meaningful digital legacies that can be shared with future generations.

- Emotional connection: Bridge temporal gaps by allowing people to connect with their past selves and share meaningful moments across time.
